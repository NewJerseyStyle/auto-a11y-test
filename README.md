# ü¶æ Your Website Through Screen Reader - AI-Powered Accessibility Testing

> **"We discovered our web page was impossible to navigate with a screen reader. This tool found it in 10 minutes."**  
> ‚Äî *That's why we implemented this to help us allocate our energy in coding*

## üéØ What if CI/CD could see your website the way 285 million visually impaired people experience it?

Every day, millions of people use screen readers to navigate the web. But most websites are never tested with real screen reader technology. **Until now.**

This tool uses artificial intelligence to navigate your website exactly like a blind user would - using real screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver), discovering barriers, and reporting what works and what doesn't.

### üí° Why This Matters

- **15% of the world's population** lives with some form of disability
- **$13 trillion** in annual disposable income from people with disabilities
- **Legal requirements** (ADA, WCAG) with significant penalties for non-compliance
- **Better for everyone** - accessible sites rank higher on Google and work better on mobile
- **Afordable and scalable** - get most out even if you cannot get a a11y specialist

## üöÄ For Accessibility Testers & QA Teams

### What This Tool Does For You

Instead of manually testing every page with a screen reader (which can take days), this tool:

1. **Automatically navigates** your entire website using AI
2. **Uses real screen readers** (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
3. **Attempts real user tasks** like "Find the contact information" or "Purchase a product"
4. **Reports exactly what fails** with specific error messages and locations
5. **Runs on every code change** to catch issues before they go live

### Real-World Example: Testing an Online Store

Let's say you want to test if customers can complete a purchase using only a screen reader.

**Without this tool:** Manual testing takes 4-6 hours  
**With this tool:** Automated testing in under 5 minutes

Here's what you'll discover:
```
‚ùå FAILED: Complete a purchase
  - ‚úÖ Found product catalog
  - ‚úÖ Added item to cart
  - ‚ùå Checkout button has no accessible label
  - ‚ùå Payment form fields missing descriptions
  - ‚ùå Order confirmation unreachable via keyboard
```

And the output list will be attached to the Pull Request comment before the maintainer decided to pass or reject.

## üìñ Quick Start Guide (No Coding Required!)

### For Accessibility Testers

If your development team has already set this up, you just need to:

1. **Create a test scenario** - Write what you want to test in plain English:
   ```
   Find and read the privacy policy
   Navigate to contact page and find phone number
   Complete newsletter signup
   ```

2. **Ask your dev team** to convert these tests into the YAML format

3. **Review the reports** - You'll get clear, readable reports showing:
   - What the AI could accomplish ‚úÖ
   - What failed and why ‚ùå
   - Exact WCAG violations found
   - Suggestions for fixes

### For Development Teams - 10-Minute Setup

#### Step 1: Add to Your GitHub Repository

Create a new file `.github/workflows/accessibility.yml`:

```yaml
name: Accessibility Testing

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Test Accessibility
      uses: NewJerseyStyle/auto-a11y-test@main
      with:
        url: 'https://your-website.com'
        goals: |
          Navigate to the contact page
          Find customer service phone number
          Locate business hours
          Test the search functionality
        ai-provider: 'openai'
        ai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

#### Step 2: Add Your API Key

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your OpenAI API key (get one at https://platform.openai.com)

#### Step 3: Watch It Work!

Every time you push code or create a pull request, the AI will:
- Test your website with a screen reader
- Post results as a comment on your pull request
- Alert you to any accessibility failures

| "API key not valid" | Check your API key is correctly set in GitHub Secrets |
| "Navigation timeout" | Increase `max-steps` parameter or simplify test goals |
| "Cannot find element" | Ensure your site has proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML |


## Results

The output will be a simple report detailing:

* **Successfully Achieved Goals:** A list of goals that were successfully completed.
* **Failed Goals:** A list of goals that were not successfully completed, along with potential reasons for failure (if identified).  This section should provide actionable feedback for improving the website's accessibility and UX.
* **Accessibility Issues:** A list of identified accessibility issues, such as missing alt text or poor semantic HTML.

## User Experience Considerations

This proof-of-concept prioritizes ease of use for both the AI and human users. The AI's actions are designed to mimic the natural flow of a human user interacting with a website using a screen reader. The system's design aims to be intuitive and straightforward, minimizing any complexities that might hinder accessibility for users with disabilities.  Future development will focus on user testing to further refine the UX and ensure accessibility for a wide range of users.

## Testing Methodology

The AI testing methodology is designed to simulate real-world user interactions. This includes:

* **Realistic Navigation:** The AI navigates the website using screen reader commands that a human user would typically employ.
* **Error Handling:** The system incorporates robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations, such as broken links or unexpected website changes.
* **Accessibility Checks:** Beyond goal completion, the system also performs basic accessibility checks, such as verifying the presence of appropriate ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.

## Limitations

1. The AI testing system only consider keyboard navigation. Did not provide insights in touch screen.
2. The AI may need more instruction in order to control the behavior to mimic specific operation styles (e.g. reading each element on website vs jumping to next header).
3. The screen reader support only added for NVDA, VoiceOver also supported by not implemented.
